# MySEScripts

Collection of scripts I've ended up making for myself during my playthrough. You can find a detailed description of what each script does in the `{$project}/Instructions.readme` file.

Here I'll give a short description of the script that I feel a random person might be interested in. A bunch of these scripts are just random exeperiments and me playing around with MDK and the SE api.

## FuelManager

A script that's designed to run on your ships. When connecting to a station, it sets batteries and gas tanks to recharge. It also has a somewhat basic display for ship stats.
